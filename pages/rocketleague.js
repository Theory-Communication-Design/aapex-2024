        Rocket League is an arcade-style, automotive soccer game that allows<br />
        millions of players to drive for the win. The Mobil 1â„¢ brand has joined forces<br />
        with Rocket League to bring together the worlds of gaming and performance.<br />
        This is achieved through in-game items and decals, and real-life giveaways.<br />
        Additionally, the well-known North American Rocket League team, GenG Mobil 1<br />
        Racing, was formed as a result of a sponsorship between American eSports<br />
        organization Gen.G eSports and the Mobil 1 brand. The seamless integration of the<br />
        Mobil 1 brand into a video game with an extensive reach allows sponsors to tap into a<br />
        young, dynamic, and engaged audience.
