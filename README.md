# AAPEX-2024 Project

Welcome! This project was created specifically for the AAPEX 2024 event. Please follow the instructions below to run the project on your local machine.

## Running the Project

1. **Locate the `CLICK ME!` File**  
   After unzipping the folder, you should see a file named `CLICK ME!.bat`. This is a Windows batch file that starts the local server.
   - This batch file will launch the project using a program called **Mongoose**.

3. **Run the `CLICK ME!` File**  
   Double-click the `CLICK ME!` file to start the local server.  
   - If a security prompt appears, you may see the option "Don't run". Go ahead and click "More info" instead. This will now give you the option "Run anyways", please select **Run anyways**.

4. **Wait for the Application to Start**  
   Two Windows PowerShell windows will open. Please leave both of them open while the application is running.  
   - It may take 1-2 minutes for the application to start.
   - Once started, the project will automatically open in your preferred browser with the URL `localhost:8000`.

5. **Adjust the Screen Size (if needed)**  
   This project is optimized for a screen resolution of 3,840 x 2,160. If you are not using a screen with this resolution:
   - Right-click anywhere on the site and select **Inspect** to open Chrome DevTools.
   - Click the second button at the top left corner that looks like a square and small rectangle (labeled "Toggle device toolbar").
   - From the dropdown, select **Responsive**.
   - Enter the custom size of `3,840 x 2,160` to match the intended screen size.

6. **Make the Window Fullscreen (Windows)**  
   To get the best experience, make the browser window fullscreen. You can do this using one of the following methods:
   - **Method 1:** Hold down the `Fn` key and press the `F11` key.  
   - **Method 2:** Click the three vertical dots in the top right corner of your browser (next to your profile icon) and select **Full Screen** from next to the zoom options.

7. **Close the Project**  
   Once finished, close all related windows to stop the application.
